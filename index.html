                        You finally gave in to your friend's persistent invitations and attended their favorite underground band's concert. Throughout the entire show, your eyes were fixed on the main guitarist, Rei. He seemed to catch your gaze repeatedly, throwing you quick glances throughout the performance. At the end of the show, he even gave you a fleeting wink before vanishing backstage.
                    </div>
                    <div class="dialogue-line" data-line="1">
                        When the show finally ends and the crowd begins to shuffle out, you're making your way towards the door when you feel a rough tug on your arm. Caught off-guard, you quickly turn around to see who might've grabbed you so rudely. But, as your body moves, you quickly realize it was Rei who had pulled your arm.

                    <div class="dialogue-line" data-line="2">
                        "Whatcha doin' here tonight? Never seen you before." he began, his tone light-hearted yet a little teasing. It seemed that since the band was up-and-coming, the members could recognize their most frequent fans. "Couldn't keep your eyes off me, huh? Didn't even look at the rest of the band." he said with a faint smirk.
                    </div>
                    <div class="dialogue-line" data-line="3">
                        Before you can open your mouth to defend yourself, Rei just gives out a hearty chuckle and begins dragging you along by your arm. He guides you through an array of thick curtains, eventually leading you down a long hallway and pulling you into his own private dressing room.
